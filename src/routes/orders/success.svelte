				<h3>Order Confirmation and Receipt</h3>
				<p>
					If you've landed here, that means all of the crazy squirrels in the clouds did their jobs.
					In your inbox, you should see two confirmation emails, a receipt from the credit card
					processor, and a welcome message from THAT. <span class="font-bold">
						If you're not seeing those, please check your junk/spam folders as sometimes we manage
						to land there accidentally.</span
					>
					At any time you can view your <a href="/my/settings/order-history">order history</a> and reprint
					your receipt.
				</p>
